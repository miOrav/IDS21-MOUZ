# IDS21-MOUZ
We have a jupyter notebook, in order to run it, you have to run all the cells in the order of which they are positioned. 
WARNING, the training of the neural network will take a long time.

What the code does: 
First we load in the data, and change it to the shape we need.
Then we load in the images.
Then we create a function to create the model of our neural network.
Then we do a little more work changing the data to a shape most useful.
After that we make, compile and train our model. This will take a long time (At least on my computer).
After that we predict on the validation data and do some analyzing
After that we do predictions on the test image set.
After that we build some classifiers for the metadata, and analyze the results of those models.
